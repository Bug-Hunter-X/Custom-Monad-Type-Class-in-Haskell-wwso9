This repository contains a Haskell program that demonstrates a custom `MyMonad` type class, which duplicates the functionality of the built-in `Monad` type class.  The example showcases instances for lists, `Maybe`, and `IO`.  The code highlights a potential issue: creating a custom type class that mirrors existing functionality can lead to confusion and may obscure the use of standard library functions.  The solution focuses on using the existing `Monad` type class. This is generally preferred for clarity and to leverage existing optimizations and utilities.
